# Description
This is a web application that displays some of my biographical/professional information--including my resume, LinkedIn, and GitHub pages--contact information, and an under-construction portfolio page of various projects that I've created during these first two months of learning to code. The intention is to use this as an employer-ready/competitive tool after completion of the Computer Coding Bootcamp at UPenn/Trilogy.

Users can access interactive photos and a portfolio page that is linked, in addition to finding a number of ways to make contact. 

# Future Implementation
Future implementations will include 
-further refinement of display properties
-the implementation of more dynamic programming
-the limitation of baked-in HTML/CSS code

# Built With
Visual Studio Code - standard coding.
HTML.
jQuery - Javascript libraries.
Materialize - CSS framework.

# Contributing
If you wish to contribute ideas to this work-in-progress, feel free to reach out to me in any of the ways listed on the website itself. Alternatively, feel free to follow me on GitHub, at which time I will certainly follow you back, and express that you'd like to contribute ideas for improvement. 

Please be sure to keep all criticism constructive and avoid using deratory/insulting language. That said, do not shy away from criticizing what I've created so far. I'm always open to learning new things and finding new ways or doing things.
